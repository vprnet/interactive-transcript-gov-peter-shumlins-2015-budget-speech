    <p><span><a data-m="1700" class="thewords">Thank you.  Mr. President, Mr. President pro tem, Mr. Speaker, members of the General Assembly, Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished guests, fellow Vermonters &#x2014;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="17400" class="thewords">As I stated here a week ago, we have many challenges and opportunities ahead.  Today, as I deliver the toughest budget that I&#x27;ve put together, I&#x27;ll present to you part two of my plan for how we can better secure a better future for all of us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="37600" class="thewords">When I listen to the voices of Vermonters from every corner of our state, from every background, and from every political persuasion, they&#x27;re frustrated and uncertain about their futures.  And the frustration is clear:  They play by the rules, they work hard, sometimes at more than one job, but their bills keep piling up faster than they can bring in the money to pay them.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="67800" class="thewords">At a time when the gap of wealth between the people at the top and everyone else is more extreme than since before the Great Depression, Vermonters hear about the recovery both in Vermont and nationally&#x3b; they hear about our state&#x27;s low unemployment numbers, and they wonder, &#x22;Why aren&#x27;t I seeing it&#x3f;  Why is my family being held back&#x3f;&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="94400" class="thewords">We know many of the drivers of this unease:  Rising health care costs and rising property taxes, among others, with no corresponding rise in incomes and property values.  Many hardworking Vermonters who would be proud to call themselves members of the middle class are left with a feeling that they&#x27;re treading water, or worse, dipping below the surface.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="123200" class="thewords">Like a family trying to adjust its budget to meet its reality, it&#x2019;s our responsibility as state leaders to match opportunity for all of us, to fill our potential as citizens, family members, workers, and business owners.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="141000" class="thewords">Though many Vermonters are struggling with affordability, all the news isn&#x27;t bad news.  Our state economy is doing much better now than when I became governor four years ago.  Unemployment is down, jobs are up, and foreclosures and bankruptcies have dropped sharply.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="162800" class="thewords">General fund revenues grew &#x24;175 million &#x2014; &#x24;175 million &#x2014; from FY &#x27;11 to FY &#x27;14.  Contrast that with 2008 and &#x27;09, when state revenues fell by more than &#x24;97 million, and Vermonters were losing jobs left and right.  Nevertheless, when I gave this speech last year, the official revenue forecast for &#x27;16 was &#x24;40 million higher &#x2014; higher &#x2014; than it is today.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="196400" class="thewords">A year ago the consensus economic forecast was that our state revenues would go up by five percent in this budget year, enabling us to grow our way back &#x2014; grow our way back &#x2014; to a balanced budget.  But that hasn&#x2019;t happened.  We now know that revenue this year will, at best, grow by only three percent, and we continue to expect a downgrade in projected growth when our economists release an update later this month.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="228200" class="thewords">So looking ahead, the general fund is expected to grow around 3.5&#x25; for the next five years &#x2014; for the next five years.  Now, we&#x27;ve already made some tough decisions together and reduced the FY &#x27;15 budget by &#x24;34 million.  Many of these ongoing spending reductions were carried forward into our &#x27;16 budget.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="254400" class="thewords">Over the past four years we&#x27;ve also been weaning the state off the significant one&#x2d;time federal stimulus dollars that helped pull Vermont and so many other states through the downturn without completely eviscerating state government.  We&#x27;ve reduced our reliance from a high &#x2014; a high of &#x24;59 million in fiscal &#x27;12, to the &#x27;16 proposal that I&#x27;m putting forward today, which includes only &#x24;11 million of non&#x2d;recurring revenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="288800" class="thewords">Reduced growth rates in Vermont and across the country, dried up federal funds, the need to promote affordability for all Vermonters &#x2014; these realities lead to a single, challenging conclusion:  Working together, we must take a different approach by curbing state spending to bring the cost of state services back in line with our growth.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="315500" class="thewords">While it will take more than one year to adjust to this new reality, my F &#x27;16 budget makes a strong start.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="325100" class="thewords">Now, to those who would call upon us to solve our &#x24;94 million budget gap by raising it in taxes.  I&#x27;m here to tell you that it won&#x27;t work.  Even if we could somehow magically afford it.  Because our economy is growing more slowly than our state spending.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="346400" class="thewords">Simple math tells us that we would have to raise revenue year after year after year if we fail to match our spending rate with our growth rate.  That&#x27;s just the hard reality.  With all this in mind, I&#x27;m presenting a balanced budget, knowing that it&#x2019;s the beginning of a conversation &#x2014; the beginning of a conversation &#x2014; regarding how to structure state government sustainably to meet the needs of all Vermonters.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="375600" class="thewords">You can expect me to engage deeply with you in how best to do this.  I want to share the five principles &#x2014; five principles that guided our work.  First, I won&#x27;t charge our budget challenges that we have today to our kids and grandkids tomorrow.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="399100" class="thewords">My budget fully funds our retirement contributions to debt obligations.  I&#x27;m proud that we&#x27;ve maintained one of the strongest bond ratings in the country.  With Vermonters struggling to pay their property tax bills, I&#x27;ve also fully funded the general fund transfer to the education fund.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="418000" class="thewords">Second, state government must address ways to be more efficient.  Therefore, I propose more than &#x24;15 million &#x2014; &#x24;15 million of ongoing savings, driven by this principle.  These include streamlining and consolidating government services and restructuring some programs.  It&#x2019;s a necessary job of all good organizations &#x2014; public and private &#x2014; to continually look at what they do and ask this question:</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="450300" class="thewords">&#x22;Is what we&#x27;re doing meeting our core principles&#x3f;  And are we doing it in the best way that we possibly can&#x3f;&#x22;  These choices are rarely popular or without critics.  Change is always hard.  All these cuts and others detailed in the budget have been proposed because I believe that we can offer them while still providing core state services.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="478600" class="thewords">But let me be clear:  They&#x27;re real.  I know each matters deeply.  And they&#x27;re tough.  In addition to personnel or labor cost savings, I&#x27;m proposing consolidation of some state libraries, public safety call centers, the on&#x2d;site septic program, and the Community High School of Vermont.  I propose that we not include state LIHEAP in the base budget this year, relying instead on our past practice of stretching our &#x24;18 million of federal appropriation as far as we can.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="519000" class="thewords">While we cannot fill all the holes left by federal cuts, we will use the budget adjustment to make necessary enhancements year by year, as we have in the past.  My budget counts &#x24;125 of Social Security income towards Reach Up eligibility to make it consistent with some other state programs.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="540300" class="thewords">This reduces total Reach Up spending while preserving all other aspects of the program, including those that were added last year when we went to fix the benefit cliffs, the good work that you did there.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="554400" class="thewords">My budget also presents a net reduction of funding for 11 state employee positions, and requests additional savings of approximately &#x24;9 million, &#x24;9 million, in personnel costs.  This will require the Vermont State Employees Association to support some of the choices that our budget will present, to reduce salaries and expenses in other ways, to avoid even larger problems if we fail.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="583800" class="thewords">I know that we&#x27;ll debate these and other parts of the budget throughout the session, but I ask critics of my proposals for restructuring to follow one simple rule &#x2014; one simple rule:</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="597600" class="thewords">If you don&#x27;t like my recommendations, propose your own to achieve equal, ongoing savings.  Equal, ongoing savings.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="608700" class="thewords">Our third principle is this:  Wherever possible, make smart choices, by not cutting programs that deliver more to Vermonters in economic opportunity and support than they cost us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="624700" class="thewords">You&#x27;ll see that we retain investment in the Vermont Rental Subsidy, the Vermont Family Supportive Housing Initiative, and the Emergency Solutions Grant, that have a proven record of avoiding temporary motel shelters and helping homeless move into stable housing.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="643500" class="thewords">For programs that help sustain our most vulnerable, we&#x27;ve held spending wherever possible &#x2014; wherever possible &#x2014; at last year&#x27;s levels.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="655000" class="thewords">The fourth principle underlying our budget proposal is that we should not cut state programs if it will do more harm than good down the road, as we saw in the depths of the recession with cuts that eroded our ability to adequately protect Vermonters, including &#x2014; including vulnerable children.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="677000" class="thewords">My budget does not cut one dime from Child Protection Services.  In fact, it supports the increased staffing and other progress that we&#x27;ve made in response to the tragedies of last year.  While we may never entirely prevent people with empty hearts from committing horrible crimes &#x2014; horrible crimes against those they should love and protect, the state must do everything it can to help our most vulnerable children, and we will.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="709800" class="thewords">We&#x27;ll present a proposal to you this year to strengthen communications, transparency, enforcement and protection in our child safety work.  We also use the Position Pilot that you wisely authorized last year to allow DCF to better manage workload within its existing appropriation by adding social workers as well as other child protection staff within its present budget authority.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="738200" class="thewords">While this is necessary and a substantial start, more is needed.  I want to thank the department and its hardworking staff for the improvements they&#x27;ve already made to further the work, and we&#x27;ll do further work with Senator Sears and Ayer, Representatives Lippert and Pugh, and all of you &#x2014; all of you &#x2014; to better protect our children.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="761400" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="777800" class="thewords">One truth that we should acknowledge, the horrible tragedies inflicted upon innocent children across our state this year &#x2014; DCF custody and non&#x2d;DCF custody &#x2014; were all driven by one thing:  addiction.  Addiction.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="796800" class="thewords">In their memory, in the memory of those children, we must continue our work to prevent opiate and heroin abuse.  The budget I propose continues support for treatment centers, recovery centers, and our statewide Criminal Justice Rapid Intervention Program, and increases by 16&#x25; overall drug treatment spending, to make sure that last year&#x27;s progress is more than a one&#x2d;time success.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="826400" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="835300" class="thewords">Together, together, Vermonters are facing the ravages of heroin and opiate addiction in our families, friends and communities, and we must continue the fight.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="846900" class="thewords">Finally, my budget relies on the principle of balance &#x2014; balance.  We cannot just restructure and close our &#x24;94 million hole without inflicting significant damage upon Vermonters who desperately need us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="869600" class="thewords">You&#x27;ve heard many times over the past four years my opposition &#x2014; my opposition to raising income, sales and rooms and meals tax rates to fund government.  I remain convinced that our tax rates are already high enough, and as I travel across our state, Vermonters echo that view.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="894700" class="thewords">Nevertheless, to meet a portion of our budget gap, I&#x27;m proposing that we close an income tax loophole that we partially fixed in 2009, by eliminating the deduction of state and local taxes paid from state tax returns.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="913000" class="thewords">Vermont is in the minority of income tax states that still allows taxpayers who itemize to use this loophole to deduct from this year&#x27;s state taxes the taxes they paid last year.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="927700" class="thewords">The average benefit for those who use this deduction is &#x24;175.  Eliminating it raises &#x24;15.5 million towards our budget gap.  This is progressive and principled approach.  It&#x2019;s the right thing to do.  It&#x2019;s timely and sensible.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="946500" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="954500" class="thewords">Now, I hope that we can return to these five principles as we debate this year&#x27;s tough budget together.  I don&#x27;t insist that I have all the answers.  I do know that we must work together to fund state government and deliver services affordably to Vermonters.  That&#x27;s our job&#x3b; let&#x27;s do it together.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="979100" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="987400" class="thewords">Balancing our budget is only a part of our responsibility this year.  The key to our future is growing a vibrant, entrepreneurial economy that supports jobs and better wages.  Last week I urged all of us to seize our advantage to power Vermont forward in energy innovation, to grow more jobs and lower energy bills for Vermonters.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1015800" class="thewords">I urged us to take the anger and frustration we feel when we see and smell algae blooms in our lakes, to do more to protect our waters that are so vital to our economy and our quality of life.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1028200" class="thewords">We also know that the future of our working families and job creators depends upon improving access and affordability of health care by getting control of the unsustainable increases in health care spending.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1043200" class="thewords">The future of our children depends upon finding solutions to the high cost of public education while improving quality and moving more of our kids beyond high school.  The future of our state depends upon offering greater access to higher education and job training, and providing better support for our employers, who drive economic development and job creation across our state.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1069500" class="thewords">Let me tell you my proposals in each of these areas:</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1075700" class="thewords">I have pursued health care reform for nearly two decades now because I know how much the ever&#x2d;rising cost of health care hurts family and businesses.  The US health care system is unsustainable, unfair, and unaffordable for too many.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1094400" class="thewords">I know perhaps better than anyone else in this room just how hard it is to change our health care system.  Yet it&#x2019;s absolutely critical &#x2014; absolutely critical that we do so, or it will destroy the rest of our economy and the ability of Vermonters to pay their bills &#x2014; the big challenge they&#x27;re having right now.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1116600" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1125800" class="thewords">That&#x27;s why, that&#x27;s why, despite the challenges and recent setbacks, I remain absolutely committed to continuing improvements to our health care system so that we can fulfill the vision set forth by Act 48.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1141300" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1149900" class="thewords">Let&#x27;s make real progress together, by moving to payment for quality outcomes instead of the number of procedures, by fixing the state&#x27;s chronic underpayment of Medicaid, which shift costs and artificially inflates private insurance premiums, and by increasing health care access and affordability for all Vermonters.  Let&#x27;s do it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1174200" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1180700" class="thewords">Here are five ways that I propose to accomplish these goals:  First, we need to accelerate the hard work we&#x27;ve begun on cost containment and move to a more rational way to pay our providers.  It doesn&#x2019;t make any sense that doctors in hospitals receive different amounts of money for the same procedures, depending upon who pays.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1207600" class="thewords">I all, it also doesn&#x2019;t make any sense that our providers get paid for the number of procedures they perform, not the results.  Not the results.  Our current payment system does not reward healthy outcomes&#x3b; it creates administrative headache for our providers.  It underpays our primary care community, which threatens their survival &#x2014; their survival &#x2014; and it isn&#x27;t fair because some of us &#x2014; usually our businesses that offer health insurance, and those of us that have private insurance &#x2014; end up paying more than our share to support the cost of the health care for the entire system.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1247300" class="thewords">That&#x27;s why we must push full steam ahead to become the first state to move from the current fee for service payment system to one that pays providers for the quality outcomes they produce, by pursuing our all&#x2d;payer waiver with the federal government with all vigor.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1266500" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1274900" class="thewords">The Green Mountain Care Board is working closely with my health care team to submit a waiver application that will allow us to align how we pay our providers across private insurance and public programs, to ensure that providers have the right incentives for improving quality while bending the unsustainable cost curve.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1294600" class="thewords">This should be achievable by January 2017 if we all work together, and I ask for your support.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1303600" class="thewords">Second, to aid in these efforts, I propose that we strengthen the Green Mountain Care Board &#x2014; strengthen &#x27;em.  The board is already successfully containing cost and moving the state steadily to a new, more rational payment system.  In the past two budget years, the board has held hospital spending growth at just three percent &#x2014; less than half the growth rate that we&#x27;ve seen over the previous seven years, and the lowest hospital growth rate in over 30 years &#x2014; 30 years.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1338900" class="thewords">To make sure that the board institutionalizes its early containment cost successes, I&#x27;m gonna ask the legislature to enhance the board&#x27;s role as the central regulator of health care, so that it can treat health care like the public good that it is. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1364000" class="thewords">The Green Mountain Care Board, which was created by you in part based upon the well&#x2d;established regulatory model of our Public Service Board, should also have the ability to open investigations into pressing issues and other acts where needed.  It needs the a by to align health care technology investments with a more unified system statewide by having budgetary and programmatic oversight over the Vermont Information Technology Leader, VITL.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1393800" class="thewords">The board should also have the power to approve innovative payment and delivery models promoted by our accountable care organizations, physicians and clinics.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1404600" class="thewords">Make no mistake:  The board faces significant challenges, since national health care costs are expected to grow over six percent annually, six percent annually, by 2019.  While many of the other 49 states might sit back and continue health care business as usual, Vermonters cannot afford to do so.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1430100" class="thewords">In order to continue our cost containment progress, we must strengthen our board&#x3b; it&#x2019;s that simple.  I ask for your help. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1444300" class="thewords">Third, third, we need additional investments in Vermont&#x27;s Blueprint For Health to build on the early successes in reducing costs while improving quality.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1457200" class="thewords">This has been central to our reform efforts.  Our job now is to position the blueprint for a strong future.  Our Blueprint Medical Homes and Community Health teams have effectively increased social services for the sickest and most needy Vermonters on Medicaid, and have reduced the medical needs of those with private insurance, while saving about &#x24;550 per person every single year.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1485200" class="thewords">Today, its future is at risk because participating providers haven&#x27;t seen an increase in pay since the blueprint launched &#x2014; no increase.  My budget fixes this by more than doubling payments to Medicaid&#x27;s Blueprint providers with a new &#x24;4.5 million appropriation, including increasing Medicaid&#x27;s Community Health Team payments by &#x24;1 million, and adding &#x24;3.5 million to medical home payments.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1518400" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d; It&#x2019;s long overdue.  My budget also supports our hardworking home health organizations with an additional &#x24;1.25 million to help them move forward with payment reform.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1535700" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve also proposed that we expand to more Vermonters the good work done by the home and community providers like Support Services at Home, SSAH, that program, and Vermont Care Alliance, by supporting my request for an additional &#x24;500,000 that will draw down &#x24;5 million in federal match.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1557400" class="thewords">Programs like these, they keep Vermonters with chronic conditions healthier by managing their needs before &#x2014; before they get sick.  It saves money and improves quality of life, and we should make this model more widely available to more Vermonters.  This investment makes sense.  I ask for your support.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1580200" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1587200" class="thewords">Fourth, fourth:  In order to make sure Vermonters have access to the care they need, we need to fix the state&#x27;s broken Medicaid reimbursement rates.  We gotta fix it.  Anybody in business will tell you that when you get paid as little as 40 to 60 cents on a dollar of cost, you can&#x27;t stay in business.  This isn&#x27;t tough math.  This puts our independent rural providers with high numbers of Medicaid patients at the greatest risk.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1622000" class="thewords">All across Vermont, providers who treat Medicaid patients have two choices to limit their losses &#x2014; two choices:  Charge patients with private insurance a higher rate, or turn away Medicaid patients who desperately need care.  Current Medicaid reimbursements drive up private insurance cost for businesses and individuals, acting as a hidden tax cost shift.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1652500" class="thewords">This amounts to an astounding &#x24;150 million in private premium inflation in Vermont every single year.  Our failure to fix this by increasing state Medicaid reimbursements also means that we&#x27;re failing to draw down on tens of millions of dollars in available federal matching funds.  Now, that&#x27;s just foolish.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1675300" class="thewords">Therefore, my budget invests &#x24;25 million starting January 1st of &#x27;16, providing a 50&#x25; increase to our primary care providers, and reducing the current Medicaid cost shift by half &#x2014; cutting it in half.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1703000" class="thewords">My budget will also commit nearly &#x24;30 million in &#x27;16 to cover nearly 20,000 people &#x2014; 20,000 people &#x2014; who now have insurance coverage, thanks to Vermont Health Connect and our Medicaid expansion. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>

    <p><span><a data-m="1957700" class="thewords">This proposal makes sense for businesses that provide health insurance because we can reduce the cost shift overall by more money than the taxes raised, by drawing down the federal match and lowering in private insurance premiums.

To roll back the more than &#x24;230 million in increased education spending added in the past decade all at once would require us to immediately eliminate at least 2,500 of our teachers or close dozens and dozens of our schools.</a></span></p>

This past summer I asked my Education Secretary, Rebecca Holcombe, to begin this work.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2589200" class="thewords">Impressively, she&#x2019;s already met directly with members of almost every single school board in Vermont, and has shared data which every district in the state needs.

    <p><span><a data-m="2608200" class="thewords">Now, we know there&#x27;s a will to act at the local level.  With overwhelming support, &#x5b;unintelligible&#x5d; voters in six participating school districts approved a new merged district into a single board.  Working together, they&#x27;ll now have the power to provide superior and affordable education to their kids, and I applaud them for taking on change.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2638700" class="thewords">Now, other communities &#x2014; and I know you represent many of them &#x2014; are engaged in similar conversations right now.  Vermont schools are built upon a long tradition of local control.  But we have to ask, what does that really mean today&#x3f;  What does it really mean&#x3f;  For many communities where student counts have dropped precipitously, local control means board members finding themselves no longer in a position of deciding what opportunities to provide for their students, but instead deciding what opportunities they can take away.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2680900" class="thewords">That&#x27;s the truth.  Do we cut foreign languages&#x3f;  Arts&#x3f;  Sports teams&#x3f;  Technology&#x3f;  Computer classes that are critical to the kids futures&#x3f;  Meanwhile, even if one town makes the cuts, makes the tough decisions, the town next door often doesn&#x2019;t, thereby driving up costs for everyone else, and making local control more like local not in control.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2709900" class="thewords">That&#x27;s what&#x2019;s happened.  But if you really want to make a mess out of our school system &#x2014; I mean a real mess &#x2014; ask Montpelier to come up with a one size fits all solution of central control.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2725800" class="thewords">Every time we try to solve the big problems in education by ourselves under the golden dome, we run into a reality roadblock.

    <p><span><a data-m="2749500" class="thewords">That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so convinced that partnership is the answer &#x2014; the partnership of local communities with my agency and state Board of Education, and all of us in this room, driven by real data about quality and cost, will result in more affordable systems with better outcomes for our kids.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2772100" class="thewords">This will make local control, real control, partnered with the state.  Now, just in case you&#x27;re wondering what you&#x27;re gonna do this winter, Montpelier has a critical role to play in this partnership.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2787800" class="thewords">We&#x27;re fortunate that so many have come forward with ideas to help, but no one is sure exactly which solution may work.

    <p><span><a data-m="2846100" class="thewords">My Agency of Education has today launched online tools right on our website to help communities understand their education spending, phantom students, tax rates, enrollment and staffing.

    <p><span><a data-m="2882700" class="thewords">Third, third, we must phase out or eliminate contradictory incentives built into the funding formula, like small school grants and the phantom student provision&#x3b; it just makes common sense.</a></span></p>

    <p><span><a data-m="2902400" class="thewords">Fourth, fourth, we will target construction aid for districts that are actively trying to right&#x2d;size through a merger.  My capital budget proposes &#x24;3 million for this purpose&#x3b; we gotta do it.</a></span></p>

    <p><span><a data-m="2924500" class="thewords">Fifth, fifth, we should pass legislation prohibiting both teacher strikes and board&#x2d;imposed contracts while we require both sides to resolve their differences through third&#x2d;party decision&#x2d;making when negotiations fail. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2948300" class="thewords">Sixth, we should consider giving enhanced redistricting authority to the State Board of Education, or another entity if you choose, when schools are orphaned and need to be part of a bigger union&#x3b;&#x00a0;we can&#x27;t just leave them out there.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2964800" class="thewords">Seventh, we should make sure decisions such as principal hiring, health care contracting and other significant spending takes place at the supervisory union level, and we should empower principals to hire all staff in their schools.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2983000" class="thewords">These proposals will help, but a bigger transformation is required to truly bend our cost curve and shore up our challenging and challenged schools.  So here is our big idea:  Last year you appropriated &#x24;5.3 million to the Agency of Education to help evaluate what we&#x27;re buying with our education fund dollars.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3014800" class="thewords">Let&#x27;s find out what we&#x27;re buying.  I have asked Secretary Holcombe to use this significant commitment to broaden and deepen our education quality review program, to help communities get a clearer picture of how effectively they&#x27;re serving students, and how effectively they&#x27;re spending their money.  The agency will go into schools with evaluation teams of colleagues and state experts.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3040600" class="thewords">They&#x27;ll use data to set educational and fiscal targets involving student performance, school climate, per&#x2d;pupil spending, and spending increases, and staff and student&#x2d;teacher ratios, among others.  They will then help school districts achieve the goals.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3064000" class="thewords">Take the evaluations, make the changes.  We&#x27;ll partner with them to do it.  We&#x27;ll work with our most vulnerable districts first, and our goal will be to support improvement.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3077900" class="thewords">A partnership means working together, but we must be prepared to act when necessary.  We will give districts time to make progress, but if they don&#x27;t make improvements in their fiscal or educational results, we should either adjust the funding formula to ensure that other taxpayers don&#x27;t support continued bad choices, or, when absolutely necessary, find ways to exercise authority to close those schools.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3114100" class="thewords">I propose we work this session to structure this enhanced review system to improve quality and cut costs.  Now, I know that my proposal will not be welcome by everyone. &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3131000" class="thewords">But I do hope that you will consider them thoroughly and review them with an open mind, realizing that even more drastic solutions will be demanded by Vermonters, and they will if we fail to act &#x2014; if we fail to act.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3152400" class="thewords">It will take time, hard work, courage for sure, and partnership in Montpelier and in our schools and our communities, to see progress.  But it&#x2019;s critical, it&#x2019;s critical that we start right now.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>

    <p><span><a data-m="3475500" class="thewords">This year we&#x27;re going to increase our job training efforts with more than &#x24;3.3 million in next&#x2d;generation and other funds for our workforce training programs.  They&#x27;ll also benefit from &#x24;6.6 million in a recent federal grant for workforce training to help the long&#x2d;term unemployed in partnership with UVM, our state colleges and Vermont HITEC.  That&#x27;s tremendously good news.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3505800" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3511300" class="thewords">Now, I bet some of you wouldn&#x27;t have predicted this a decade ago, but today our advanced manufacturers are on the come back, employing more than 11&#x25; of our entire workforce.  We&#x27;re seeing innovative companies such as Mack Molding down in Arlington &#x2014; Sears&#x27;s way&#x3b; he finally woke up &#x5b;laughter&#x5d; &#x2014; GW Plastics in Bethel, GW Plastics in Bethel, successfully expanding into growing markets like medical devices.  Vermont Precision Tool in Swanton has hired some of the very capable workforce from Kennametal in Lyndonville.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3548300" class="thewords">In Bennington, car parts fabricator NSK is adding jobs and has employed some of Plasan&#x27;s former workforce.  Cabot Hosiery has seen orders for its Darn Tough, Made in Vermont, best in the world socks, double &#x2014; double &#x2014; as they expand their physical plant and add manufacturing jobs.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3570300" class="thewords">The list of manufacturers going strong and creating jobs is incredibly impressive.  We expect our newest advanced manufacturing company, and our biggest, will build on the foundation on one of our oldest.  When IBM announced that it would sell its chip manufacturing division to Global Foundries, we entered into a new era of advanced manufacturing in Vermont.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3600000" class="thewords">In Global Foundries, we will have a partner who will see Vermont&#x27;s successes as its successes.  The company is, in essence, a very large startup.  If the IBM sale is approved, Global Foundries will essentially double, double its US workforce in one fell swoop.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3626800" class="thewords">It will gain a foothold through its strategic acquisition of the Vermont operations in providing state of the art chips that nearly every wireless device, from your smartphone to your tablet, relies upon today.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3643200" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3649700" class="thewords">Global Foundries will also gain our highly skilled, innovative workforce, the best you can find anywhere, and it&#x2019;s offered jobs to every single employee who is not being retained by IBM&#x3b; every single one of &#x27;em. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3673100" class="thewords">Meanwhile, IBM will maintain &#x2014; and this is news to some &#x2014; a presence in Vermont, with continued R&#x26;D work at the Essex campus, for hundreds, hundreds of current IBM employees, which is also very good news for Vermont.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3689900" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3692900" class="thewords">Now, we&#x27;re partnering with Global Foundries to help ensure its Vermont success.  I&#x27;m incredibly grateful to the productive meetings that I&#x27;ve had with CEO Sanjay Jha and his team, and have asked my Commerce Secretary, Pat Moulton, to work closely with Global Foundries to support this new company&#x27;s growth and investment in Vermont.  We will continue to be accessible, nimble, supportive, innovative, as we build this really critical relationship.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3728400" class="thewords">The spirit of innovation, it&#x2019;s alive and well all around our state.  Burlington was named one of the top emerging tech hubs in the country last year.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3738800" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d; It was.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3745400" class="thewords">In addition to Dealer.com, MyWebGrocers, that are both growing, there&#x27;s a new wave of high&#x2d;tech startups, like our Launch Vermont Pitch Contest winner, IrisVR, online game designer Game Theory, Designbook, a new groundsourcing and startup platform, and the new ad&#x2d;free social media site Ello, which had as many as 40,000 users sign up in one hour this past September.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3775800" class="thewords">That growth isn&#x27;t just in Burlington.  Pwnie Express in Barre has been recognized by Wired Magazine for its cybersecurity devices.  Global&#x2d;Z down in Bennington has quietly become a global leader in data management.  Yonder, the app that Backpacker Magazine described as &#x2014; and I quote &#x2014; &#x22;what happens when Instagram and Foursquare meet at REI and have a baby together&#x22; &#x2014; is growing in Woodstock &#x2014; growing in Woodstock.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3808800" class="thewords">Our economic development programs, including the Vermont Employment Growth Incentive, VEGI, the Entrepreneurial Lending Fund, the Vermont Small Business Offerings Exemption, and others, are nurturing businesses at all stages, and helping to foster this job growth.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3827300" class="thewords">In its most recent awards rounds, the Vermont Economic Progress Council used VEGI to leverage &#x24;21.4 million &#x2014; &#x24;21.4 million &#x2014; in new full&#x2d;time payroll, and over &#x24;37 million in qualifying capital investments in the recipient companies over the next five years.  That&#x27;s a lot of investment. &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3856100" class="thewords">Now, these investments are spread throughout the state, from National Hanger Company in North Bennington to Vermont Packing House in Springfield, Blodgett Ovens in Essex, with their awards, these companies will create now more than 550 new jobs with an average yearly salary of more than &#x24;50,000 each &#x2014; &#x24;50,000 each.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3881800" class="thewords">VEGI has been an important, successful economic development tool, and it&#x2019;s the one that we must continue to help sharpen, to help improve our economy.  Therefore I&#x27;m gonna ask you to make the following three improvements to the program:</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3899300" class="thewords">First, we&#x27;ll present a proposal to remove the &#x24;1 million cap for special projects outside of Chittenden County.  Second, we&#x27;ll work with you to change the qualifying wage rate, to recognize regional economic differences, increasing the number of companies around the state that qualify for job creation support.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3924500" class="thewords">And third, we&#x27;ll also enable companies to use VEGI dollars earlier so they can train new hires.  All of this will help us to grow jobs and economic opportunity.  I ask for your support.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3948200" class="thewords">Now, another of our economic drivers continues to be tourism.  We&#x27;re within a day&#x27;s drive of more than 80 million people starving &#x2014; starving &#x2014; for what Vermont offers:  Our quality of life, our ski slopes, bike trails, hiking trails, our beautiful downtowns, our award&#x2d;winning beer, our award&#x2d;winning cheeses, our local foods, and so much more.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3976600" class="thewords">They come to experience all the things that we love about Vermont.  Growing tourism grows our economy, and it supports more than 30,000 jobs in Vermont.  That&#x27;s why I will partner with the Vermont Chamber of Commerce on a plan to use increased revenue from the rooms and meals tax to boost our tourism and marketing efforts.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4003300" class="thewords">In 2014 visitors to Vermont spent more than &#x24;2.5 billion.  &#x24;2.5 billion.  I propose that we take 15&#x25; of future growth from our rooms and meals tax receipts, above budgeted projections, and invest it in tourism and marketing support and promotion, capping it at &#x24;750,000.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4027500" class="thewords">This budget&#x2d;neutral proposal will grow jobs and promote Vermont.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4043300" class="thewords">We also need to shout from the rooftops &#x2014; shout from the rooftops &#x2014; what a great place Vermont is for technology businesses, manufacturing businesses, and startup businesses.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4057200" class="thewords">We need to do a better job of telling the story of our remarkable entrepreneurs, because they show that Vermont&#x27;s a great place to work and to do business, and they know that more than anyone.  We launched our Great Jobs Vermont campaign because we know that when folks visit Vermont, they fall in love with Vermont, and they want to come back to work and start up businesses, as so many of our currently successful entrepreneurs did before they got here.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4085500" class="thewords">So we want others to learn what we already know: Vermont is the best place &#x2014; the best place &#x2014; to live, to work, to raise a family&#x3b; let&#x27;s spread the word.  &#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4116100" class="thewords">It&#x2019;s an extraordinary privilege &#x2014; an extraordinary privilege &#x2014; to govern a state where we all know each other, where our citizen legislature shows the country how to take on the biggest challenges we face, and where we really put aside partisan differences that can paralyze democracy.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4138300" class="thewords">Each of us comes to elected office filled with the intention to do good for our community and for our state.  Every election is an opportunity to remind ourselves of our purpose, and renew our commitment to help Vermonters through our service.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4157900" class="thewords">Vermonters expect nothing less from us, and I believe they deserve even more.  I hope the proposals that I&#x27;ve presented today, and last week, will help tackle the big problems we currently face, and leave Vermonters with a feeling that their state government can make their lives and our state better.  I look forward to the opportunity to debate, shape and implement these proposals with you this session, and beyond, to make lasting progress for jobs, affordability, our kids, our quality of life, and our environment.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4196800" class="thewords">Thank you so much.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4198200" class="thewords">&#x5b;applause&#x5d;</a></span></p>
